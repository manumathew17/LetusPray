</p>

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<p>My Jesus, this cross should be mine, not Thine;  my sins crucified Thee.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
</p>
<h1>Third Station</h1>
<p>Jesus Falls for the First Time
    We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You.
    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.
</p>
<h1>Mediation</h1>
<p>Come and see our Savior enduring so much suffering, so many insults, and oppressed with the heavy burden of the cross, for love of us. Contemplate the Son of God, Redeemer of the world, and how much He is suffering. O Jesus in Your sufferings I see the gravity of my sins. Lord have mercy!
</p>

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<p>O Jesus! by the first fall, never  let me fall into mortal sin.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
</p>
<h1>Fourth Station</h1>

    We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You.
    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.
</p>
<h1>Meditation</h1>
<p>The Sorrowful Mother seeks her Divine Son, Jesus; she meets him on the way to Calvary; she sees Him bound, crowned with thorns, with the cross on his shoulders. O Queen of Martyrs, we also have been your sorrow that, like a sharp and unrelenting sword has pierced your soul.
</p>

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<p>O Jesus! may no human tie, however dear, keep me from following
    the road of the Cross.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be

</p>



<h1>Sixth Station</h1>
<p>Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus
    We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You.
    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.
</p>


<h1>Meditation</h1>
<p>The remembrance of the most holy Passion of Jesus Christ is the door through which the soul enters into intimate union with God, interior recollection and most sublime contemplation. It must be impressed deeply on our souls as we allow ourselves to be immersed in His bitter sufferings, for through these the love of God is enkindled in us and we will then be plunged in the abyss of the divinity.
</p>

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<p>O Jesus! Thou didst imprint Thy Sacred features upon Veronica's veil; stamp them also indelibly upon my heart.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
</p>

<h1>Seventh Station</h1>
<p>Jesus Falls for the Second Time
    We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You.
    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.
</p>


<h1>Meditation</h1>
<p>The greater number of Christians live unmindful of all that Jesus, our Life, has done and suffered. That is why they live on, sleeping in the night of iniquity.
</p>

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<p>By the second fall, preserve me, dear Lord, from relapse into sin.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
</p>



<h1>Eighth Station</h1>

    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.
</p>

<p>The most holy Passion of Jesus Christ is the most efficacious means to convert obstinate sinners, because meditation on the sufferings of our Savior has power to root out vice and implant love and holy fear of God in the soul.
</p>

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<p>My greatest consolation would be to hear Thee say "Many sins are forgiven thee, because thou hast loved much."
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be

</p>

<p>O Jesus! When weary upon life's long journey, be Thou my strength and perseverance.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
</p>



<h1>Tenth Station</h1>
<p>Jesus is Stripped of His Garments
    We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You.
    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.
</p>


<h1>Meditation</h1>
<p>Jesus permitted Himself to be despoiled of His garments on Calvary in order to teach us to renounce our own will when it is not conformable to the will of the Father. He wants us to strip ourselves of earthly affections and all inordinate love of the things of this world, so that we may clothe ourselves with the virtues of Christ.

</p>

<p>My soul has been robbed of its robe of innocence; clothe me, dear Jesus, with the garb of penance and contrition.

We must strive for great detachment from creatures in order to be united only with the Creator, through the various sufferings and pains of life, endured for the love of God, in patience, silence in the midst of all the sacrifices demanded by our state in life, and by practicing the virtues taught by our Divine Savior.

</p>
<h1>Meditation</h1>
<p>Jesus died to give us life all creatures are in sorrow the sun is darkened, the earth trembles, the rocks split, the veil of the temple is rent; will only our heart remain harder than the rock?

We beseech you, Holy Mother, grant that the Passion of our Lord may be for us a fountain of sorrow, of pardon, of love and of life.

<p>Receive me into Thy arms, O Sorrowful Mother; and obtain for me perfect contrition for my sins.
    One Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be
</p>



<h1>Fourteenth Station</h1>

    Because by Your Holy Cross You have redeemed the world.

<h1>Meditation</h1>
<p>Devotion to the Passion of Jesus is the easiest way to be saved. The crucifix is a book wherein we learn every virtue, we learn the science of the saints, and therein we find all.
</p>
